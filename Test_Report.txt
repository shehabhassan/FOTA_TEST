Test Report - Software Testing

Project: Vehicle Control System
Test Date: 2025-03-03
Tester: Mahmoud Saad
Environment: Windows 11, ESP32, SIM7600

Test Summary:
This test verifies the functionality of the vehicle control system, focusing on data communication, response time, and system stability.

Test Cases Executed:
1. Verify HTTP GET request from SIM7600 to GitHub server.
   - Expected: Successfully receive and display firmware.txt content.
   - Actual: Passed.

2. Validate vehicle control neural network model's response time.
   - Expected: Response time < 50ms.
   - Actual: Passed (Response time = 42ms).

3. Check sensor data logging accuracy.
   - Expected: Sensor readings match actual conditions.
   - Actual: Failed (Discrepancy in velocity readings).

Defects Identified:
- Bug #1023: Incorrect acceleration data in logs.
- Bug #1045: Occasional timeout in HTTP request.

Conclusion:
The system is functional, but minor issues need resolution. Recommended bug fixes before deployment.

End of Report.
